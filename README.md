# heart_detection
heart detection with CNN using X-ray images

In this project I developed a cnn model that predicts the heart position with bounding box on the X-ray images.

I provided the labeled data which contains the positions of heart in the picture. (rsna_heart_detection.csv)

I developed and trained the model on kaggle because of needing GPU.

Besides you can data from kaggle --> https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data
